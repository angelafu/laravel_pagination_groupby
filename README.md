I. Requirement:
1. List the books purchased.
2. Book are sorted in descending order by the last customer purchase time.
II. Analysis:
The relationship between books and purchases is one too many. Which means one book can be purchased many customers. I need all the information of the book as well as the last purchase date of this book so that I can list the books in the order of the latest purchase date.
for example:
Book A is purchased by 2 people on 1/7/2020 and 3/7/2020. The latest date 3/7/2020.
Book B is purchased by 1 people on 2/7/2020. The latest date 2/7/2020.
Book C is purchased by 3 people on 1/7/2020, 2/7/2020, 4/7/2020. The latest date is 4/7/2020.
The ideal result should be:
book_name latest_purchase_date
C 4/7/2020
A 3/7/2020
B 2/7/2020
III. Solution:
1. Tables
Table one: categories

Table two: books
	id(PK)
